# Sales Data with Timeseries Features

I have synthesized mock time-series sales data generated using the NumPy library of Python, which can be used to test and play around with forecasting models. 

## About Dataset

The code for the same can be found in the 'Sales Data Code' notebook. It is tuned so that weekends portray higher sales than weekdays; the seasonality coefficient has been set to 7. The data is scalable and can be increased by simply tweaking the parameters of the accompanying code.
